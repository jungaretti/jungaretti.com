Located in the mountain-ringed Tularosa Basin, White Sands consists of the southern part of a 275-square-mile (710km) field of white sand dunes composed of gypsum crystals—the world's largest gypsum dunefield. The park is completely within the White Sands Missile Range and is subject to closure when tests are conducted.
