The Grand Canyon, carved by the mighty Colorado River, is 277 miles (446km) long, up to 1 mile (1.6km) deep, and up to 15 miles (24km) wide. Millions of years of erosion have resulted in a massive three-tiered canyon, exposing the multicolored layers of the Colorado Plateau in mesas and canyon walls, visible from trails that descend into the canyon from the north and south rims.
