I dreamed of visiting Crater Lake since I moved to Seattle. I finally visited during my Ring of Fire road trip with Keith, Caleb, and Steve. We visited for star photos and returned the next day to hiked to Watchman Lookout. The views from the top were great, and we spent an hour up there relaxing and chatting.
