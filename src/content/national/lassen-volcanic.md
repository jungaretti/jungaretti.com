Keith, Caleb, Steve, and I camped at Lassen Volcanic during our Ring of Fire road trip. We did a night hike to the top of Cinder Cone and watched an incredible sunset. The next morning, we hiked to the top of Lassen Peak. The hike was challenging, but the views at the top were incredible. Lassen Peak was my first volcano summit.
