I biked to Saint Edwards via the Burke-Gilman trail. There are tall hills in Kenmore and Kirkland, but they aren't too steep. It was absolutley beautiful today: 65 degrees with clear skies. I met up with Chava in Kirkland for lunch and an Arnold Palmer. I took the 520 trail home. What a fantastic day!
